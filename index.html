<h1>Bird Of Paradise Plant Care Guide</h1>

<p2>Unusual, gorgeous, tropical. If you’ve ever mistaken a plant

<p2>Bird of

<p2>Strelitzia reginae is a species of evergreen tropical
 herbaceous plant, native to South Africa. Given its own family
 Strelitziaceae by taxonomists,<br><p2> it is still closely related to 
bananas (Musaceae). Many often mistakenly call this plant the 
“banana tree” because it looks like banana plants.<br> <p2>These regal
 plants (for which they are named, reginae) are named for the 
beautiful, orange crane-like flowers that they produce, like birds
 of<br><p2> paradise. They are known for bright orange-blue colors, 
however, there are also white birds of paradise. Under the right
 conditions,including full,<br><p2> southern light exposure, proper
 humidity, and temperature, Bird of Paradise may flower indoors,
 although this is rare.</p2>
<br>
<br>

<p2>The split leaves that give the Bird of Paradise 
its bird-like morphology is scientifically believed to be
 purposeful leaf tearing or lobing of leaves <br><p2>to reduce drag in 
the wind. They have evolved to create splits along their lateral 
leaf seams to allow the wind to pass by. In doing so, they <br><p2>
eliminate the risk of being snapped in half by a strong wind.

<p2>“Practically Plant Royalty: This plant’s scientific
 name commemorates Charlotte of Mecklenburg-Strelitz, Queen 
consort and wife of<br><p2> King George III. Queen Charlotte was a patron 
of the arts and an amateur botanist, and helped to expand Kew 
Gardens.”</p2>

<h1>Bird Of Paradise Plant Care 101</h1>

<p>Sunlight</p>
<p2>Thrives in bright indirect light to full sun when acclimated.
 Not suited for low light conditions.</p2>

<p> Water </p>
<p2> Water every 1-2 weeks, allowing soil to dry out between 
waterings. Expect to water more often in brighter light and 
less often in lower light. Pro tip:</p2>
<p2> Birds of Paradise can 
benefit from filtered water or water left out overnight before
 using.</p2>

<p>Humidity</p>

<p2>Normal room humidity will do, but the Birds of Paradise 
prefers humid conditions if possible. Consider incorporating
 a fine-mist mister or</p2>  <p2>humidifier to boost the humidity level
 indoors.</p2>

<p>Temperatur</p>
<p2>Most houseplants prefer temps in the 65°F-85°F range
 (18°C-30°C). It’s best not to let it go below 60°F (15°C).</p2>

<p>Soil</p>
<p2>Use a well-draining potting mix. Mix in ingredients such as 
perlite orlava rocks to increase soil aeration as needed.</p2>

<h1>Common Problems with Growing <br>Birds of Paradise</h1>

<p2>The Bird of Paradise is an easy-going plant and is generally
 pest-free but can be prone to spider mites. Treat pests as soon 
as they<br></p2>  <p2> appear with weekly sprays of a natural pesticide like 
neem oil and regular wipe-downs of the plant.</p2>


<br>
<br>

<p2>SYMPTOM: Splits along sides of leaves
CAUSE: Normal adaptive precaution to help the plant
 bear strong winds in its natural habitat
</p2>

<br>
<br>

<p2>SYMPTOM: Yellowing lower leaves, wet potting mix
CAUSE: Overwatered</p2>

<br>
<br>

<p2>SYMPTOM: Wilting, curling leaves, dry potting mix
CAUSE: Thirsty plant, underwatered</p2>
<br>
<br>


<h1>Are Bird of Paradise Plants Toxic?</h1>



<p2>Birds of Paradise can be irritating to cats, dogs, and
 humans if the foliage is consumed. The best practice is always
 to keep houseplants out of reach </p2><p2> of small children and pets.
